# Swimming Tracker
This tracker will track rounds and times via rfid scanner on our arduino and show it to you via website.

This programm uses PHP to update the mySql database on the arduino and to get/update data for the website.

To run this programm:

-Set up mySql database wich is included in the folder db.

-Upload .ino wich is in the Arduino folder on as many arduinos as u wish.

-Set up website folder.

(We used xammp where we host the files in the xammp directory)
